# coursera_gettingandcleaning_data_finalproject

#Introduction
This repository contain my final project of the "Getting and Cleaning Data‚Äù courss.

#Raw Data
The data is used in the final project is: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
The CodeBook.md in this repository have the information indicate to all variables and calculation summaries.

#Script
Use R script to process the data and make the raw data cleaning and subset the specific varaibles and export as a tidy data set
All R scripts are saved in run_analysis.R file in the repository

The following processese were made:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

#Tidy Data
The data file export after the 5 step processes are saved in tidy.txt data file.
